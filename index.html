          Facing foreclosure of their homes in the "Goon Docks" area of Astoria,
          Oregon, to an expanding country club, a group of children who call
          themselves "The Goonies" gather for one final weekend together. The
          children come upon an old treasure map hidden in Mikey and Brands'
          parent's attic and soon find themselves on a quest to hunt down the
          treasure and infamous pirate by the name of "One-Eyed Willy", believed
          to be located somewhere nearby.<br /><br />

          <br />Join Mikey and Brand, and their friends Data, Mouth, Andy and
          Stef as the children embark on a journey that takes them through
          multiple caves and tunnels throughout Astoria. Unfortunately, Chunk,
          one of the goonies, was captured by the Fratellis, a mother and her
          two sons, a trio of criminals. While being held captive in an
          abandoned restaurant that served as their outpost, Chunk eventually
          met and befriended a third son of the Fratellis, a disfigured human by
          the name of Sloth, who was kept shackled in the basement.<br /><br />
          Along the way the group of children evade various booby traps and the
          Fratellis, who through Chunk, find out about the same treasure. Watch
          this adventure to find out if the children ever discover "One-Eyed
          Willy" and if the rumors of the treasure are true. Beware of the
          Fratellis, as they will be on your trail every step of the way.
